# Handwritten Digit Classification using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the **MNIST dataset**. The model learns spatial features from images and achieves high classification accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- CNN-based deep learning model for digit recognition  
- ReLU activation to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem  
- Regularization techniques to improve generalization  
- End-to-end training and evaluation pipeline  
- Visualization of model performance  

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction  
- ReLU activation functions  
- Max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction  
- Fully connected layers for classification  
- Softmax output layer  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook
